# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

# ABSTRACT : The Stock Market Dashboard is a Python desktop application developed to help users understand stock market behavior using real data. Instead of depending on complex trading platforms, this application provides a simple and interactive way to view stock price trends and trading activity. The project uses the yfinance API to fetch live and historical stock market data and displays it through a user-friendly graphical interface created using Tkinter. Users can enter a stock symbol and instantly view its price movement over the last three years along with the latest market price. Graphs are used to make data easier to understand and visually appealing. The application uses manual refresh to give users control over data updates and reduce unnecessary API calls. This project mainly focuses on data accuracy, clarity in visualization, and ease of use, making it suitable for learning stock market concepts and basic financial analysis.

# AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project is to create a simple stock market dashboard using Python. The objectives are to fetch real stock data, display historical and current prices, visualize trends using graphs, and provide an easy-to-use interface that helps users analyze stock performance clearly.

# COMPONENTS AND DESCRIPTION: Python is used as the main programming language to develop the application. Tkinter is used to design the graphical interface, allowing users to interact with the dashboard easily. The yfinance API is used to fetch live and historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance. Matplotlib is used to draw graphs that represent stock price trends and trading volume in a visual format. The datetime module helps in calculating the three-year data range. These components work together to create a smooth and reliable stock analysis application.

# PROCEDURE: When the application is launched, the stock dashboard window appears on the screen. The user enters a stock symbol in the input field and clicks the “Fetch / Refresh” button. The system then connects to the yfinance API to collect three years of historical stock data along with the current stock price. If the entered symbol is invalid, an error message is shown. After fetching the data successfully, the old graphs are cleared and new graphs are displayed. The user can refresh the data manually whenever needed.

# RESULT DECRIPTION: The final result of this project is a working stock market dashboard that shows accurate and real stock information. Users can see a line graph representing the stock price movement over the last three years and a bar graph showing trading volume. The current stock price is also displayed clearly on the dashboard. The graphs are well-spaced and easy to understand, helping users analyze trends quickly. The manual refresh option allows controlled data updates. Overall, the project successfully combines real data, visualization, and a clean interface into a practical application.
